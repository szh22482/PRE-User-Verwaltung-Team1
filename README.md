# PRE-User-Verwaltung

Welcome to our PRE-Project Usermanagement for an audit-system:  
The User Management Website is a comprehensive system for managing user accounts and roles. Here are the most important framework conditions, objectives and features:  

`Roles`  
There are four roles: Administrator, Auditor, Auditee and Sysadmin. Each person can have several roles. The roles can only be modified by the sysadmin.

`Masterdata`  
A list of master data is transmitted and a table is created in the database.  

`User management`  
The administrator can invite and add people. Users can be modified and deleted. When deleting, the user is not removed from the database, but a field is set to True or False.   

`Technology`  
Java & VueJS application. The database runs in Docker.
